I hold myself and any team I lead to a high standard of integrity and accountability, whist encouraging empathy, humility, and resilience. I excel at establishing a positive and vision-orientated workplace culture, and have a great deal of experience in project management, resource delegation, and generally managing people.",

In 2014 I began designing 3D printed houses for builders to present to customers during the design phase; but unfortunately the technology simply couldn't meet expectations, so I managed to successfully 'fail fast'.\n\nMore recently, in 2018, I developed a recruitment platform which aimed to combine the profiles of LinkedIn and the roles of Seek, skip resumes and cover letters, and jump straight to face-to-face interviews. The project was shelved after being convinced by someone 'in-the-know' it was already in the works by Microsoft and Seek... I am still waiting for that to come true. Finally, in 2019 I co-founded a medication platform for pharmacies to share medication availability and prices to prescribing doctors."
